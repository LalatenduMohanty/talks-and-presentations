[.topic.source]
== Objective

====
* Introduction to GlusterFS
** What is GlusterFS?
** Quick overview on key concepts
* Use cases
* Ecosystem integration
* Introduction to Storage SIG
====

[.topic.source]
== Objective

====

* Tutoral session on Deploying GlutserFS
** Installing, creating and mounting a GlusterFS volume.
** Puppet Gluster
* Other GlusterFS features
====

[.topic.source]
== What is GlusterFS

====
* A  general purpose scale-out distributed file system.
* Aggregates storage exports over network interconnect to provide a single unified name space.
====

[.topic.source]
== What is GlusterFS

====
* Filesystem is stackable and completely in userspace.
* Layered on disk file systems that support extended attributes.
====

[.topic.source]
== GlusterFS Architecture

====
* Software only, runs on commodity hardware
* No external metadata servers
* Scale-out architecture
* Extensible and modular
* Largely POSIX compliant
====

== GlusterFS concepts – Trusted Storage Pool

====
* Trusted Storage Pool (cluster) is a collection of storage servers.
* Formed by invitation to a new member from any one member of the exiting pool.
* Members can be dynamicaly added or removed from a pool
====

[.topic.source]
== GlusterFS concepts - Bricks

====
* Combination of a node and an export directory – for e.g. hostname:/dir
* Each brick inherits limits of the underlying file system
* The ondisk file system should support extended attributes.
====

[.topic.source]
== GlusterFS concepts - Bricks

====
* No limit on the number bricks per node
* Ideally, each brick in a cluster should be of the same size

[.topic.source]
== GlusterFS concepts - Volumes

====
* A volume is a logical collection of bricks.
* Volume is identified by an administrator provided name.
====

[.topic.source]
== GlusterFS concepts - Volumes

====
* Volume is a mountable entity and the volume name is provided at the time of mounting.

[source,sh]
----
mount -t glusterfs server1:/<volname> /my/mnt/point
----
*  Bricks from the same node can be part of different volumes
====

[.topic.source]
== Volume Types

====
* Type of a volume is specified at the time of volume creation
* Volume type determines how and where data is placed
* Following volume types are supported in glusterfs:
** Distribute
** Replication

== CentOS Storage SIG

====
* To ensure that CentOS is a suitable platform for many different open source storage solutions
* It is an opertunity to use CentOS as a platform and build latest/greatest software on it.
====

[.topic.source]
== CentOS Storage SIG

====
* An easy way to consume new technologies within CentOS ecosystem.
* Aims to provide best upstream user experiance.
* Current Projects
** GlusterFS
** Ceph
** OpenAFS
** SCST
====

[.topic.source]
== How to get involved with Storage SIG

====
* All discussions happen on centos-devel mailing list
* http://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Storage
