== Objective ==
* Introduction to GlusterFS
** What is GlusterFS?
** Quick overview on key concepts
** Use cases
* Introduction to Storage SIG
* Tutoral session on Deploying GlutserFS
** Installing, creating and mounting a GlusterFS volume.
** Puppet Gluster
* Other GlusterFS features

== What is GlusterFS ==
* A  general purpose scale-out distributed file system.
* Aggregates storage exports over network interconnect to provide a single unified name space.
* Filesystem is stackable and completely in userspace.
* Layered on disk file systems that support extended attributes.

== GlusterFS Architecture ==
* Software only, runs on commodity hardware
* No external metadata servers
* Scale-out architecture
* Extensible and modular
* Largely POSIX compliant

== GlusterFS concepts – Trusted Storage Pool ==
* Trusted Storage Pool (cluster) is a collection of storage servers.
* Formed by invitation to a new member from any one member of the exiting pool.
* Members can be dynamicaly added or removed from a pool

== GlusterFS concepts - Bricks ==
* Combination of a node and an export directory – for e.g. hostname:/dir
* Each brick inherits limits of the underlying file system
* The ondisk file system should support extended attributes.
* No limit on the number bricks per node
* Ideally, each brick in a cluster should be of the same size

== GlusterFS concepts - Volumes ==
* A volume is a logical collection of bricks.
* Volume is identified by an administrator provided name.
* Volume is a mountable entity and the volume name is provided at the time of mounting.
** `mount -t glusterfs server1:/<volname> /my/mnt/point`
*  Bricks from the same node can be part of different volumes

== Volume Types ==
* Type of a volume is specified at the time of volume creation
* Volume type determines how and where data is placed
* Following volume types are supported in glusterfs:
** Distribute
** Replication
** Dispersed
** Stripe
** Distributed Replicate
** Striped Replicate
** Distributed Striped Replicate
** Distributed Dispersed
